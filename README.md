# WheelEngine
A custom game development framework written in Vulkan

This is the render engine component of a game development stack I am working on called WheelEngine.

Currently, this framework supports 
  Drawing multiple objects individually
  Has a camera object which can be moved and from which the scene can be rendered
  Abstracts most core vulkan features
  Keeps track of keyboard and mouse inputs
  
The next set of features being developed (in no particular order) include:
  Rendering to images and saving those rather than rendering directly to the display
  Material system to allow objects to be drawn with different shaders
  Texturing objects
  Lights
